# Mission
Our mission is to provide renewable energy for the northeast region in Brazil,
as we researched the industry to find the best solution, and we found that the 
**Solar Energy** is the most suitable option for the region's weather conditions, 
not only because of the climate, but also the cost savings that our technology 
will provide in the long run, making it a sustainable and economically viable 
choice for farmers and communities.
